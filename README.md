# Paddle-Frontend-Assessment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The Home Page with the routing "/" does not display anything as per the instructions and guide given for this project.

The Coming soon page is displayed on the routing "/comingsoon" and this has consists of a Navigation bar, the page content and a footer. On the Navigation bar we have the Logo at the LHS, while the links to other side of the page are links to the other pages on this project.

The about-us page is displayed on the routing "/about" and this consists of the Navigation bar also, the page content and the Footer.

The blog page is displayed on the routing '/blog' but this page just displays an header and the footer as the implementation of this page wasn't compulsory.

## Installed Dependecies

In this Project, I installed:

### react

This is the javascript Library that was used in building this project

### react-router-dom

This is used for easy routing between severally pages that are available on this Web-App

### spinners-react

This is used to display a spinner whenever the GitHub page is fetching data from the GitHub API endpoint that was provided. This display of the spinner is just a way of implementing a good User experience so that when ever the page is load, the user can be aware that it is actually loading, and they should exercise patience.
